BreakJS

  Breakout-style game made in JavaScript

Overview
========

  This was a proof to myself that I was capable of coding a game in Javascript in under 24 hours. I plan to improve and extend the game within the coming days. I also plan to write a step-by-step tutorial once the code is refined. With that in mind, feel free to checkout the code.
